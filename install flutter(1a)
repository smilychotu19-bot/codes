Flutter already comes bundled with the Dart SDK — so when you install Flutter, you don’t need to install Dart separately.
Step 1: Download Flutter
Go to the official Flutter website:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
Choose your Operating System (Windows / macOS / Linux).
Step 2: Extract Flutter SDK
•	Extract the downloaded .zip file.
•	Place it in a suitable location like:
•	C:\src\flutter
Step 3: Add Flutter to System Path
1.	Press Windows + R → type sysdm.cpl → OK
2.	Open Environment Variables
3.	Under System Variables, select Path → Edit
4.	Add the path:
5.	C:\src\flutter\bin
Step 4: Check Installation
Open Command Prompt and run:
flutter --version
If Flutter version shows, you're good.
Step 5: Run Flutter Doctor
flutter doctor
This checks if everything is set up correctly.
